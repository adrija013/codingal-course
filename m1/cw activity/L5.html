                    <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
                         Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.
                          The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.
                          Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

                <aside>
                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. 
                    Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.
                     They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.
                      Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.
