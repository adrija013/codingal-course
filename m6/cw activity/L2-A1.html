                <p>
                    A <b class="text-warning">volcano</b> is commonly defined as a vent or fissure in the crust of a planetary-mass object,
                     such as Earth, that allows <b class="text-warning">hot lava</b>, volcanic ash,
                      and gases to escape from a <b class="text-warning">magma chamber</b> below the surface.
                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where <b class="text-warning">tectonic plates</b> are diverging or converging,
                     and because most of Earth's plate boundaries are underwater, most volcanoes are found underwater.
                      For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by <b class="text-warning">divergent tectonic plates</b> whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates.
                       Volcanoes resulting from divergent tectonic activity are usually non-explosive whereas those resulting from convergent tectonic activity cause violent eruptions.
                        Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift,
                         the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, and the Rio Grande rift in North America.
